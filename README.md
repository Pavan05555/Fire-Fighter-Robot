ðŸš’ **Introducing My Mini Project-1: Firefighter Robot** ðŸ”¥  

I'm excited to share my first mini project, a **Firefighter Robot** designed to detect and extinguish fires autonomously!  

### **Project Highlights**:  
- **Fire Detection**: Equipped with a flame sensor, the robot quickly identifies fire sources.  
- **Water Spraying Mechanism**: A 5V mini water pump sprays water on the fire until it is completely extinguished.  
- **Smart Coverage**: Using a servo motor, the nozzle rotates from **0 to 180 degrees and back**, ensuring efficient water distribution over the fire.  
- **Robust Motor Control**: An **L298N motor driver** handles the motors, enabling precise movement and functionality.  
- **Arduino Uno Controlled**: The entire system is powered and controlled by an Arduino Uno, making it efficient and reliable.  

This project showcases how embedded systems and simple components can come together to solve real-world challenges. ðŸš€  

I'm proud of this achievement and look forward to exploring more innovative solutions. Your thoughts, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome!
